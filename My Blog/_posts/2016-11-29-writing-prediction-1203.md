#### 独立写作

如果大家有任何问题，欢迎大家参加考前**周四晚19：30分**的考前写作点题，我会带着大家一起串讲一下这些题目的思路。如果大家需要详细的答案，可以参加我们的考前机经冲刺课程。

**使用方法和建议**

机经只是我们用来跟同学们介绍方法的工具哈。我们无法保证每次机经都有原题，但是我可以保证不管考啥题目咱们的方法必然是通用的。强烈建议考前心理没啥底的同学参加一下我们的考前机经冲刺班：

```
1.拿到机经题目的答案，包括独立写作部分的模板和示范
2.认真观看2011-2015年真题串讲视频，通过小范围机经讲方法，然后通过五年的真题约200题熟悉方法的使用。既然咱都说方法是通用得了，总得证明一下吧。哈哈。既然这么多题目看过了，考前相信大家就不会太慌乱了。祝大家好运。
