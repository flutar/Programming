description: 托福独立写作结尾段的写法
---

```
结尾段我们只要简单的总结一下文章中的理由就可以了。具体写多长可以根据我们所剩的时间来决定。如果时间不够，我们完全可以只写一句话，再次声明自己的立场就成了。如果时间比较充足，当然可以总结一下正文中的理由和例子。如果写完还有时间的话，不妨发起一个倡议或者引用一个名人名言之类的。具体如何安排，得看自己的实力了。下面咱们一起看几个比较不错的结尾，希望大家从中总结出一些表达，组装成自己的结尾。
```

### 结尾段1

*When you are assigned an important presentation for work or school a month in advance, and you are required to write a presentation. Which way do you prefer? 1. To start to work on it right away, so you can work on it a little bit every day. 2. To wait until the end of the month when you have a good idea about the presentation.*

In conclusion, my preference for working on the job immediately is clearly justified through the above-mentioned reasons and examples. I am a big fan of a motto that goes, “to blossom in action or to wither in waiting”. Let's take action right away, and never let our life slip through our fingers.

这个结尾用一句话非常简单的总结了一下正文，然后引用一个名言。最后还来了一个很有诗意的畅想。第2.3句话可能可复制性不强，但第1句话还是非常非常通用的。重点表达：`be clearly justified through` 以及比较文艺的`wither` 以及 `slip through`。

#### 结尾段1示范

*Do you think success is important, or it is more important to remain happy and optimistic when you fail?*

In conclusion, my preference for *success* is clearly justified through the above-mentioned reasons and examples. I am a big fan of a motto that goes, “*the secret of success in life is for a man to be ready for his opportunity when it comes.*” Let's take action right away, and never let *success* slip through our fingers.

第一句话比较好套，直接把我们支持的点用一个名词或者短语加上去就行。第2个空比较麻烦，我直接复制了一个关于成功的名言过来。最后一个空也把 `life` 换成了 `success`。我们如果自己没有名言但还想用这个结构的话直接自己编造一个名言也成。

### 结尾段2

*Do you agree or disagree: it is easier to maintain good health nowadays than it was in the past.*

In a nutshell, it is easier to maintain good health for people nowadays than it was in the past, not only because of a higher level of medical care brought about by breakthroughs in modern medical science and technology, but of countless sports facilities which render regular exercise more realizable especially for city dwellers. But what is more important is that people should keep steadfast resolutions to say goodbye to the old unhealthy way of life and fully carry out their fitness schedules.

这个结尾的句式不错，先来一个 `not only...but also...的并列` 引出主体段中的两个并列的原因。然后再来一个 `what is more important is that` 的主语从句来发起一个倡议。我们使用的时候只要把两个理由替换一下就可以了。至于倡议部分大家可以根据自己的情况来决定是否留下。重点表达：`render sth + adj` 以及 `city dwellers` 还有 `keep steadfast resolutions to`。

#### 结尾段2示范

*Agree or disagree,  the world is changing so quickly that people now are less happy or less satisfied than in the past ?*

In a nutshell, *there is every reason to believe that people today are less satisfied than those in the past*, not only because of *exacerbating environmental conditions*, but of *increasingly rapid rhythm of life*.  What is  important for governments today is that *they should stop at almost nothing to achieve sustainable development and place emphasis on the improvement of people's life quality.*

本题是一个今昔对比的题目，立场是同意，理由是环境差、生活节奏快。我们只需要把两个理由填进去即可。最后在对政府提出期望，希望他们关注民生，重视可持续发展。重点表达有：`there is every reason to do sth` 以及 `exacerbate` 和 `rhythm of life` 还有 `stop at almost nothing to do sth` 最后还有 `place emphasis on sth`。 

### 结尾段3

*Do you agree or disagree: teachers' performance should be evaluated by students rather than by other teachers.*

From what I have discussed above, we may safely draw a conclusion that teachers' performance should be evaluated by students. Just like killing two birds with one stone, it works both as a stimulus for teachers to cater to students' individual needs and as a mirror for them to check out the weaknesses in their teaching.

这个结尾也比较简单，首先一句话明确一下立场。然后来一个谚语，顺道把文章的两个理由总结一下，效率也是非常高的。重点表达有：`kill two birds with one stone` 以及 `cater to the needs of sb` 还有 `work as a stimulus to`等等。

#### 结尾段3示范

*Do you agree or disagree that a teacher who is serious and strict is more efficient than a teacher who uses humors and is easy going？*

From what I have discussed above, we may safely draw a conclusion that * it is of greater benefit to have a teacher with a good sense of humor in order to teach more efficiently. * Just like killing two birds with one stone, teaching students in a humorous manner works both as a stimulus for students to establish a harmonious relationship with their teachers and as a precious opportunity for teachers themselves to spice up the tedious class.

本题是一个典型的二元素比较类的题目，立场是支持幽默，理由是能够学生搞好关系也能让课堂更有趣味性。重点表达：`it is of greater benefit for sb to do sth` 以及 `establish a harmonious relationship with sb` 还有 `spice up the tedious class`。
