description: 托福独立写作让步段的写法
---

```
相信很多同学目前在写独立写作的时候采用的依然是经典的五段式，中间两个理由段外加一个让步的形式。让步的作用说的直白一点就是防止我们找不到第三个理由没话写，毕竟每个题目都找三个理由真的不是那么容易，很多同学都是瞎凑。当然啦，有一个让步也显得我们的文章的论证更加完整一些。下面咱们通过几个实例来看看让步段到底该咋写。希望大家把让步的套路搞明白之后，最好能记住一套，并且学会如何针对不同题目进行更改，这样一来考场上就能节省大量的时间。
```

### 让步段1

*Students can use their mobile phones to surf on the Internet or listen to the music while doing their homework.*

Admittedly, some students claim that listening to music or surfing online can reduce the anxiety and tension while doing homework, but what you may not know is that people's sub-consciousness is actually distracted, which not only slows down the progress of the work but also burdens their nerves. Hence, the real way to relax your mind is to kick off your shoes, sit back and listen to light or classical music after having finished the entire task rather than during the process.

本题其实是一个典型的一元素的题目，这个元素就是能否看手机，我们可以把这个元素看成 `a`, 文章结构就是先说 `a` 的两个坏处，`a1- a2-`, 然后在让步的时候说 `a+`，但是由于题目的立场是反对，所有让步可以以 `a+` 开始，但是最后以 `a-` 结束，否则就会对自己的立场有一定的削弱。

#### 让步段1的示范

*It is important for the government to allocate money on beautiful things, not just for things that are practical. [2014年5月24日]*

Admittedly, some *people* claim that *spending money on beautiful things can satisfy people's higher level needs*, but what you may not know is that *the satisfaction of residents' most basic needs might be compromised*, which not only *takes a heavy toll on their living conditions* but also *poses a major threat to the government with tight budget*. Hence, *there is no better way for a country to achieve successful development than to devote its budgets to practical needs*.

本题是一个两元素比较类的题目，元素 `a` 是美丽的东西，元素 `b` 是实际的东西，而立场是支持 `b>a`，所以让步的时候我们就写 `a+ a- b+` 从说 `a` 的好处过渡到 `b` 好。这里面有几个表达希望大家注意一下。主语从句结合`not only but also` 的结构：`what you may not know is that..., which not only ... but also ....`。以及 `there is no better way for sb to do sth than to do sth` 。还有 `a take a heavy toll on b and a pose a major threat to b`。

### 让步段2

*Students can benefit from student organization and club activities as much as from their academic studies.*

Admittedly, academic study is of vital importance to every student, for it provides the basic and systematic knowledge to which we cannot be blind. However, to emphasize the importance of academic study does not mean that student organizations and club activities are dispensable. One who devotes himself to academic study without paying any attention to extra-curricular activities stands a fair chance to become a nerd with high IQ but low EQ, which is not an ideal case.

本题是一个经典的 `a=b` 的题目，立场是支持 `a>b` 然后文章结构依然是 `a1+ a2+ b+` 两个理由一个让步的形式。让步的时候 `b+ b- a+` 的套路。这里面有些表达很不错，比如：`a is of vital importance to b`, `be blind to sth`, `to emphasize the importance of a does not mean that b is dispensable`, `stand a fair chance to do sth`。这些表达希望大家重点记一下，然后融入到自己的让步段的模板里面。几个让步稍微融合一下就可以避免跟别人撞车了。

#### 让步段2的示范

*Visiting a museum is the best way to learn about a country.*

Admittedly, *paying a visit to a museum* is of vital importance to *learning about a country*, for it provides the basic and systematic knowledge *related to the country's history* to which we cannot be blind. However, to emphasize the importance of *museums* does not mean that *other ways of getting to a country are of lesser importance*. One who devotes himself to *visiting museums* without paying any attention to *other ways* stands a fair chance to *lose sight of a country's present magnificence*, which is not an ideal case.

本题是一个多元素的题目，翻译过来就是 `a>b a>c a>d ... a>n`， 我们的立场是不同意，所以最好找两个不等式来证明他们是不成立的，比如：`b>a c>a`。我们可以写上网这个方式很好啊，另外交友也是一个不错的方式啊。让步承认博物馆有好处，可以让我们了解一个国家的历史，但是如果认为其他方式不如它重要的话很可能不能够了解国家现在的成就，这就不好了。这里面又出现了两个新的短语，`lose sight of = be blind to` 还有 `be of lesser importance` 跟 `be of vital importance` 正好相反。

### 让步段3

*Do you agree or disagree: governments should spend more money in sponsoring arts than in athletics.*

Admittedly, the significance of arts cannot be overlooked; building up an artistic atmosphere is conducive to refining people's artistic taste. If a society is artistically cultivated, hardly would its people's souls be corrupted by materialism. However, compared with arts, athletics is more fundamental, i.e., without good health, people will not be able to make any great achievements including those in the area of arts. Thus, the vital importance of athletics is self-evident.

本题是一个两元素的题目，两个元素分别是艺术和体育，`a>b`。而本题的立场是支持 `b>a`。所以文章的结构是 `b1+ b2+ a+`。让步的时候依然是 `a+ b+` 的结构。这里面涉及到的比较不错的表达有：`the significance of a cannot be overlooked`, `be conducive to`, `the vital importance of b is self-evident`, 以及倒装句 `hardly would its people's souls be corrupted by materialism`。

#### 让步段3的示范

*Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? People who have learned many different skills are more likely to succeed than those who focus on learning only one skill. [2014年2月22日]*

Admittedly, the significance of *being versatile* cannot be overlooked since it is conducive to *increasing one's competitive advantage in the workplace*. If *an individual has multiple skills*, hardly would *he or she be outstripped by others*. However, compared with *learning a variety of skills*, *zeroing in on one skill* is more fundamental without which people will not be able to make any great achievements. Thus, the vital importance of *concentrating on one skill* is self-evident.

本题也是一个两元素的题目，我们只要将模板中的相应位置进行合理的替换即可。替换的时候尽量用一些同义词或者短语来避免重复。本段中也有几个不错的表达，比如：`increase one's competitive advantage` 以及 `be outstripped by = be eclipsed by` 还有 `zero in on = focus on`等等。希望大家注意总结哈。
