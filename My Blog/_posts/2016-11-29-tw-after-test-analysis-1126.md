#### 独立写作

```
It is easier to become an educated person today than it was in the past？
```
`题型：今昔对比`

`话题：教育类-接受教育的难易程度`

`思路：一边倒`

`重复：2012年11月24日 2014年3月16日 [！历年真题串讲必看！]`

>**一边倒** 本题是一个非常经典的今昔对比题目，这种题目一边倒都可以使用一样的理由，无非就是**经济、科技、和教育**。经济上现在人们更有钱了，科技上网络更加发达了，而教育上我们可以说父母受教育水平提高了，这都促使现在的人比过去接受教育更加容易。当然了，我们如果套段子的话也是完全没有问题的。比如我们可以说现在的老师非常重视孩子的兴趣，因此很多孩子更愿意学习效率高学习也很开心，而过去的老师不重视，导致很多人不愿意学习；另外，现在的老师心态普遍比过去的好，因为他们知道健康的心态对于学生的影响很大；我们还可以写现在由于学生可以评价老师，老师们会更加关注学生的个体需求。

>**分类讨论** 分类讨论其实跟一边倒只是结构不同，但针对本题来说展开的思路完全可以是一致的。今昔对比的题目我们可以按照国家和地区发展水平来分类，展开的时候我们依然可以从经济、科技、和教育三个方面对于两个地区的情况作出对比，从而得出条件好的地方确实是现在比过去接受教育更加容易，然而条件差的地方并不一定。

#### 兴趣的段子 [记忆复写第62篇]

>Choosing a favorite subject ensures one's learning efficiency, allowing him to accomplish better results. According to the data analysis revealed by a research team, school students score higher in the subjects they prefer than in the subjects they dislike. Therefore, taking up their favorite subject improves performance during their course of study and brings about more satisfactory results. In a sense, excelling in a subject paves the way for a student's academic success in the future. Conversely, if a student is forced to learn a subject not in his interest, it is difficult for him to achieve the same results, not to mention difficulty in applying it in his future career.

>To choose a favorite subject makes the learning experience full of joy, because happiness lies in the process, not just in the final result. To some extent, interest is a good friend making one joyful much of the time. For example, a math fanatic will receive considerable pleasure in the process of solving the math problems. Likewise, a biology enthusiast will embrace a cheerful moment after a new biology theory is grasped. Without doubt, fascination with a subject makes each step of learning delightful.


#### 幽默的段子[记忆复写第8篇]

>Being with those who have a good sense of humor is conducive to soothing our minds whenever we feel stressed. This is because a humorous person generally owns a positive personality that naturally makes him or her skillful in tackling stressful situations. With the company of that kind of people, we will find it easy to get rid of negative feelings. I remember one of my fellow college students is this kind of friend who likes portraying teachers as cartoon characters. Under his pen, benevolent teachers became righteous ones such as Superman or Captain America, while those serious-looking teachers became Dracula or Frankenstein. His drawings brought us endless joy even in the most demanding and stressful class.

#### 学生评价老师的段子[记忆复写第14篇]

>Firstly, the evaluation given by students effectively prevents teachers from neglecting student's individual needs. Since the result of the evaluation will be closely bound up with a teacher's bonus or promotion opportunity, teachers will be made to pay full attention to every student's special requirements and try their best to leave a good impression on students. If this proposal were adopted, the traditional classroom would take on a new look. For example, a teacher will probably change his/her serious-looking face into a smiling and relaxing one. Or a teacher will do whatever he/she can to make the class impressive by lecturing in a humorous tone or applying multimedia technology.

独立部分无非就是没思路、写不顺、写不对三个问题，没思路的一定要考前多看看历年真题串讲，多看题才能确保找思路快啊；至于写不顺或者写不对的同学，那就考前多记段子，自己写不顺、写不对就少写呗，我用别人的总不至于出问题了吧。但提醒大家，用别人的东西一定要首先记准，其次别忘了扣题，千万不要得意忘形。

**上述所有材料在考前冲刺班都有提供，大家如果考前时间比较紧，可以参加我们的冲刺班。通过模板和段子冲刺一下。模板必须搞熟，除了看示范也要自己套几个题目看看。段子要首先搞清楚思路，然后争取记住，如果记不住就把重点句式记熟，其余的东西临场发挥。**

#### 综合写作

**总体观点**
The reading is about Lascaux cave painting, painted by people living in ancient times. The reading give an image of a big horse, saying that the purpose of these cave paintings are related to hunting.


**阅读部分**

* There are subject animals matters in the painting. Animals painted on the wall are extremely large, together with motifs of arrows, most of these animals are hurt, injured by such arrows perhaps.
* Some human images on the wall are wearing animal heads. One explanation for this is that they often disguised themselves as animals in order to catch them for food.
* Third reason for this is that painting of animals is regarded as blessing to make their hunting successful.

**听力部分**

* The idea in the reading is groundless, because there are still many other small animals on the wall that these ancient often did not hunt, such as cats, and still there are many animal are not injured, and no arrows on them. The major hunting target ring deer was not on the painting. Thus not necessarily related with the hunting purpose.
* It cannot be interpreted as a camouflage since it seems like they are sleeping. 
* This represents as certain original ritual to worship the dead because they thought that the spirit of the dead were still haunting around them in terms of animal. 

>**分析** 这又是一个非常经典的`理论证明题`，此类题目无非就是从`证据本身或者从推理的角度`来进行反驳，比如第一个点，虽然阅读的证据是对的，但它是片面的。利用片面的证据显然是不能退出正确的结论的；第二个点其实跟第一个点很类似，阅读也是利用了片面的证据，只看到人家穿什么，没看到人家的姿势。第三个稍有不同，听力没有给出新的证据，直接给出新的解释。

```
综合部分大家除了练习听力之外，其实也可以多刷题，搞清楚阅读和听力的反驳关系，做多了之后猜的能力会大大加强，因为他们反驳的方式都出奇的相似，从而形成做题的感觉，大大的减少听力的压力。
