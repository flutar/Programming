#### 独立写作

```
When professor gives the assignment to require student learn as much as possible in a short time, which method is more effective? Studying together in a group or studying alone.
```


`话题：教育类`

`题型：二元素比较类`

`重复：2011年7月23日[！历年真题串讲必看！]`

>**一边倒** 今天考得同学考完写作基本都是笑着离场的，毕竟题目无论从题型和话题来讲都是简单的不能再简单的了。如果我们`一边倒`的话，完全可以考虑支持小组学习，只要跟小组挂上勾，那就是多个人，既然有个人是不是就可以`交友啊，提高非学术能力啊`，同时还可以`扩大自己的知识面啊`，这都是独立写作必备的理由吧。相信只要认真准备考试的同学都应该搞过类似的段子。

>**分类** 如果大家觉得一边倒写两个理由比较烦，分类也不难啊，`跟学生相关的题目我们可以按照年级分啊`，比如大一的学生应该多独立学习，毕竟基础课更多一些，让他们养成独立解决问题的习惯更加重要。然而大三大四的学生可能就要多一些小组活动了，既然有了一定的独立解决问题的能力，为了进一步提高自己的竞争力，他们需要学会跟别人合作。

| 时间      |    题目 |   
| :--------:|:--------:|
| 2011年7月23日  | Do you think it is more effective to work as a group than work independently? |  
| 2016年10月16日     |   Many school require young children（aged 5-11）to work together in a  small group instead of working alone to visit many activities. Do you think it is the best way to teach children? |  
| 2016年11月12日      |    Some high school teachers spend most of their class time lecturing (speaking)  to their students (typically between the age of 14-18), while the students  listen and take notes, the other high school teachers prefer to spend more class time on discussions and projects sharing ideas with each other. Which do you think is more effective for students learning? | 


#### 合作的段子[记忆复写第36篇]

>Above all, teamwork, which is greatly valued in modern world, is the key to career success. Only through interactions with partners can one master the art of cooperation, which vividly demonstrates the significance of relating well with others. At school, there are many projects or group work assigned to students. The success of any project requires the united efforts of all group members. During the course of a group task, each individual has to work together with his partner. Bearing a common goal in mind, each member is devoted to the assigned part of the task. Just like different components of an engine, everyone is interrelated. If a single part doesn't work, the whole engine may stop immediately or even break down. This example is a good demonstration of the value of working harmoniously and cooperation.

#### 培养非学术能力的段子[记忆复写第4篇]

>Firstly, students taking part in organizations or club activities can develop non-academic capabilities such as leadership, communication or execution, which are crucial for the future. It is because no matter what kind of student organization or club it is, the goal is always to achieve something with the cooperation of all members. During the process, there must be leaders who organize activities, give orders, or assign workload and members who should communicate with each other timely to ensure that everything goes smoothly. I remember that I used to be the leader of an English speaking society in college, and I successfully organized several large-scale speaking contests. The capability acquired through those activities laid a foundation for my future work.

`备考建议` 独立部分无非就是没思路、写不顺、写不对三个问题，没思路的一定要考前多看看历年真题串讲，多看题才能确保找思路快啊；至于写不顺或者写不对的同学，那就考前多记段子，自己写不顺、写不对就少写呗，我用别人的总不至于出问题了吧。但提醒大家，用别人的东西一定要首先记准，其次别忘了扣题，千万不要得意忘形。

#### 综合写作

**总体观点**

先介绍Domestication的原理和方式，然后说 Early farmers will choose to domesticate oak trees. 

**阅读部分**

* Oak trees are very easy to be domesticated because it is hardy, thus it needs very little care. 
* Acorn is a very convenient food source since it is easy to be stored and preserved and it’s not easy to spoil. 
*  Acorn has an unpleasant and bitter taste, but farmers can use the same strategy that they use to eliminate the bitter taste in Almond. Early farmers can keep picking out the almonds that taste less bitter and keep domesticating the better tasted almonds, and then they’ll get the almonds that don’t taste bitter. 

**听力部分**

- It’s true that oak trees are hardy. But it takes very long time for them to grow and fruit. It usually needs 40 years for the oak trees to grow up and no farmer is willing to wait that long. 
- Acorn has some chemicals in it which make acorns not edible. In order to get rid of these chemicals and eat the acorn, one has to boil them in the hot water for a long time. And after being boiled, acorns are very easy to decay. It takes one a lot of efforts to prepare and eat the acorn. So it can not be a very convenient food source. 
- The reason why farmers can get rid of the bitter taste in the almond is that almond only has one gene that contributes to the unpleasant taste. But there are several different genes in acorn that make it bitter. It might be easy for farmers today to use the modern genetic methods to cultivate acorns that taste more pleasant. But it is impossible for the early farmers to domesticate and get acorns taste better simply using the technique that’s effective on almonds. 

>**分析** 这又是一个非常经典的`理论证明题`，此类题目无非就是从`证据本身或者从推理的角度`来进行反驳，比如第一个点，听力承认了阅读给的证据是对的，但是指出阅读考虑的比较片面的地方；第二个点直接就攻击证据本身，阅读说方便，而听力上来就说不方便，然后给出证据论证不方便的原因；第三个点就是一个极其典型的错误的横向类比，大家只要看到作者试图通过一个做法适用于A推出也试用于B的话，肯定就是这个错误。听力必然会给出二者的不同点。而正是这些不同点导致阅读的说法是有问题的。
