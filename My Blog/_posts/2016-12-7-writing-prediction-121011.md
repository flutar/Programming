However, when it comes to children from developing countries, there is little justification for them to follow in the footsteps of their parents. Along with the acceleration of social development, people, especially young people, are confronted with unprecedentedly fierce competition. They need to work very hard to guarantee a decent life, which causes them way heavier pressures than before. Under such circumstances, most of them are prone to be caught in a sub-health state. In this case, there is no better way for them to lead a better life than to land a well-compensated job.

* Do you think the concern of environment issues in various countries can actually alleviate the environmental problem?

developed countries: superior living standard->most basic needs satisfied->are not concerned so much about basic level of needs as about higher level needs->lay more stress on A and less on B 

underdeveloped counterparts:  There are myriads of examples available globally which can shed light on the fact that the miserable life makes people suffer deeply. Niger is, by the reckoning of the UN’s Human Development Index, the poorest place on earth, once again in the grip of a food crisis.  The drought-ridden country cannot feed itself even in good years. 

Moreover, this perpetual food crisis is also compounded by high fertility rates. This gloomy living situation can be best portrayed by the depressingly common picture.

 The infants, all too often, bear the hallmarks of malnutrition. Their hair is yellowing; their bellies are distended; their expressions are glazed and they even lack the energy to shake the flies from their faces. As a result, their death is brewing. Under such circumstances, .

First, environmental protection is closely bound up with the health of every single person in this world. If the environment is polluted, the basic elements people need to survive, such as water and air, may be affected, and thus disastrous results may occur. Recently I have read an appalling story from newspapers that there is a village in the center of China where the majority of its residents, including kids and seniors, suffer from cancers such as lung cancer, stomach cancer and lymph cancer. The investigators found that the villagers' drinking water was from a river severely contaminated by the industrial discharges of enterprises located at the upstream. 

In addition, environmental protection is conducive to the sustainability of economic development. There are some idioms in China, “killing the hens for the egg”, “draining the pond for the fish”, and “burning the woods for the prey”. These ancient wisdom warns modern people not to gain profits without thinking of the future. In other words, we cannot simply satisfy the needs of contemporary people regardless of the interest of our next generation. Imagine that if we were in excessive pursuit of economic development by consuming all the natural resources, hunting for precious animals mercilessly and cutting down forests, what will become of our descendants?

Last but not least, environmental protection can boost the development of economy at the same time. For instance, a country that emphasizes its environment is usually famous for its sightseeing industry. I have been to Singapore which amazed me not only with its prosperous economy but also with its garden-like environment. The lawns, the trees, and the rivers are beautifully designed to fit into the city. This case well illustrates that conflict does not necessarily exist between economic development and environmental protection.

* The purpose of television is to educate, not to entertain.

Comedies are worth watching, for they provide a good way to relax by making people laugh, and laughing is in fact proven by science to be one of the best medicines to alleviate pressure, pain or depression. I can still remember the most enjoyable thing was to watch a Jim Carrey movie after a whole day's hard work when I was preparing for the college entrance examination--a make-or-break exam that even determines one's future.Through the dramatic performances of Jim Carrey and those hilarious plots, my intense minds got relaxed.

Another type of movies, scary movie, is also worth watching because it allows people to experience the excitement of horror under a safe circumstance. In most cases, people tend to seek entertainment without taking actual risks. The experience of fear in real life is absolutely undesirable, but the innate curiosity of human beings renders such experience in movies desirable. Though such mindset may be paradoxical, it does exist sometimes. For example, almost every scary-movie lover enjoys the moment when he or she breathes a sigh of relief at the end of the movie. Vicariously sharing the experience of others can be a kind of happiness.

* Can two people be good friends if one person has more money than the other?

children: innocent  lay more stress on shared interests or hobbies and less on financial conditions, and that is the reason why (as a result of which ) children at two ends of the financial spectrum can more often than not become congenial friends. 

adults: acceleration of social development -> fierce competition -> work very hard to guarantee a decent life -> causes them way heavier pressures than before -> be caught in a sub-health state -> public exercise equipment & awareness of the importance of doing exercises regularly->that is the reason why they are reluctant to mingle with those from lower social status

First of all, it is common interest rather than financial condition that imposes a great impact on a friendship. This is 
student organizations and clubs are the places where we can make great friends, which spices up the tedious campus life. A certain type of student organization or club is like a group or circle that appeals to people with similar hobbies or interests, and that is the reason why one can find his or her congenial friends in the club more often than not. For example, people who love taking photos will join the photography club, and movie-goers are always taking part in movie salons and exchanging mutual ideas and thoughts on the same movie. Undoubtedly, being together with people having the shared aspirations and enthusiasm is the source of happiness.

By the same token, humorous people are usually open and easy-going, which makes it easier to get along with them. As is known to all, by telling jokes and sharing experiences in a funny way, a humorous person unconsciously creates a relaxing and joyful atmosphere in which everyone involved is enjoying the moment and expecting to be with him again. For example, Joe Wong is a famous talk show comedian in America, and his hilarious acting and funny words always make his audience burst into laughter. I have watched a TV program that shows Joe Wong, in life, is particularly popular among his colleagues and neighbors because of his humorous personality.

* Agree or disagree,  the world is changing so quickly that people now are less happy or less satisfied than in the past ?

However, living in a small town often means a much more leisurely lifestyle, which is the very thing aging people pursue. Most of them are reluctant to afford high living expenses or to suffer fast-paced lifestyle. Although the average income is much less than that of big cities, the price of daily necessities, such as vegetables or meat, is usually lower. People in a small town do not have to get up so early in the morning because of their proximity to workplace and less traffic jam. Instead of suffering loneliness which is a prevalent problem in big cities, aging people are more delighted to live in a small town because they can enjoy the harmonious relationships with their neighbors. They might have fewer television channels to watch, but they have more friends readily available to chat or have fun with.

Secondly, visiting museums can also provide people with ample knowledge about the present magnificence of a country. Ranging from art and science to agriculture, museums truly cover a vast area. For instance, in science museums, demonstrations, interactive programs are adopted to introduce important scientific achievements. Visitors are given the opportunity to probe deeper into the world of science and experience its marvels. Evidently, this educational and meaningful tour will be a cherished memory for a long time. Museums of modern art are also worth a visit. With a large collection of paintings, folk art, sculptures, ceramics and metalwork, art galleries present colorful aspects of the country's cultures. Just like an open gate, museums invite people into a paradise of knowledge.

Above all, teamwork, which is greatly valued in modern world, is the key to career success. Only through interactions with partners can one master the art of cooperation, which vividly demonstrates the significance of relating well with others. At school, there are many projects or group work assigned to students. The success of any project requires the united efforts of all group members. During the course of a group task, each individual has to work together with his partner. Bearing a common goal in mind, each member is devoted to the assigned part of the task. Just like different components of an engine, everyone is interrelated. If a single part doesn't work, the whole engine may stop immediately or even break down. This example is a good demonstration of the value of working harmoniously and cooperation.

In the first place, the power of creativity far outweighs that of the basic knowledge in terms of successful inventions that dramatically change the world. Alexander Bell is commonly credited with inventing the first practical telephone. His historic sentence —"Mr. Watson, come here! I want to see you!" turned a brand new page in human history. By taking advantage of his creativity and numerous endeavors, Bell was finally granted the patent as a proof of his epoch-making contributions to the scientific field. But for his ability to be creative, such scientific breakthroughs would not have been made. In the modern world, similar evidence could also be traced. Steve Jobs, co-founder and former CEO of Apple, shocked the world with his creative electronic products whose superior functions and qualities can never be matched.
